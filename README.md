# Study Hours vs Marks – Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model
to predict student exam marks based on study hours.

## Dataset
- `study_hours_vs_marks.csv`
- Columns:
  - `no_of_hr`: Number of study hours
  - `mark`: Exam score (0–100)

## Notebook
- `linear_regression.ipynb`
- Steps:
  - Data loading & visualization
  - Linear regression model
  - Evaluation and interpretation

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Results
A strong positive relationship is observed between study hours
and exam scores, with saturation near maximum marks.
